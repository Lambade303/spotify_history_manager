# spotify_history_manager
An application inspired by git, where I press a button to create a new "commit", that saves added or removed songs from my public playlist since the last "commit". A friend of mine wanted me to do this and I think i am up to the challenge.

The application has a Listener that periodically checks for changes and creates a toast message at the bottom right corner of the screen if there are any and suggests a new commit.

Options-Tab is not working lmao.
